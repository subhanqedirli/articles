## What is Opensource?

Open source simply means that the source code of a software can be viewed, modified, or even disseminated by anyone. Examples of popular open source software are Firefox, Wordpress, Filezilla, Linux, Android and others. There are some advantages using opensource software.

### Privacy

If you are using opensource software, you can be sure that there isn't another thing running on background. But if you are using properity software you can't sure that.

They are designed by open source software and vulnerabilities can be found more easily. In other words, vulnerabilities are not found by a company, but by thousands of people.
### Support

If there is a problem with the software you are using or when you want to get help, if you are using closed source software, you will need to get help from the company that owns the software. For this, you will have to write to the support section and wait for your answers, and believe me, the support section of many companies is really terrible.

If you use open source software, it will be much easier to get support. If the software you use is popular or at least has a user base, most likely someone has experienced the problem before you are experiencing and has found the solution for this problem. You can find the solution to these problems simply by searching on the search engine. If you first face the problem, you can get help by opening a thread in a forum or by writing to the group about that software.

### Development (features & bugfixes)

Since open source software is available in Github, Gitlab and similar environments and anyone can contribute to its development, it is developed quickly and is error-free. When you encounter a problem, you can report it to the developers in the issues section. You can contribute to its development by not only reporting, but also solving the problem and committing to the project.
