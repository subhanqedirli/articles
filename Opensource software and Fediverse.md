# Opensource software and Fediverse

## What is Opensource?

Open source simply means that the source code of a software can be viewed, modified, or even disseminated by anyone. Examples of popular open source software are Firefox, Wordpress, Filezilla, Linux, Android and others. There are some advantages using opensource software.

### Privacy

If you are using opensource software, you can be sure that there isn't another thing running on background. But if you are using properity software you can't sure that.

They are designed by open source software and vulnerabilities can be found more easily. In other words, vulnerabilities are not found by a company, but by thousands of people.
### Support

If there is a problem with the software you are using or when you want to get help, if you are using closed source software, you will need to get help from the company that owns the software. For this, you will have to write to the support section and wait for your answers, and believe me, the support section of many companies is really terrible.

If you use open source software, it will be much easier to get support. If the software you use is popular or at least has a user base, most likely someone has experienced the problem before you are experiencing and has found the solution for this problem. You can find the solution to these problems simply by searching on the search engine. If you first face the problem, you can get help by opening a thread in a forum or by writing to the group about that software.

### Development (features & bugfixes)

Since open source software is available in Github, Gitlab and similar environments and anyone can contribute to its development, it is developed quickly and is error-free. When you encounter a problem, you can report it to the developers in the issues section. You can contribute to its development by not only reporting, but also solving the problem and committing to the project.

## Fediverse

To briefly explain Fediverse, I can describe it as running a service (for example, a social media service) on separate servers and keeping communication between these servers. In other words, a service run with distributed fediverse does not have a center. A service running on independent servers can run for nothing if one of these servers crashes. There is more than one advantage in fediverse.
### Freedom

Imagine you are using a centralized social network. At this time, the network owner may censor your posts or ban you from the entire network. In a distributed social network, even if you are banned from one server, you can switch to another server or open your own server and become fully independent. For this reason, Distributed social networks are completely uncensored and you can freely share what you want. Of course, all these actions must be within the framework of the law.

### Security

I don't need to tell you that the existing social networks know you better than you do. In fact, these networks know information about you that you do not know. For example, Google knows where you've been in the last 10 years better than you do. Or maybe even your closest friend doesn't know what Facebook knows about you. This is truly terrible. Distributed social networks do not collect and keep unnecessary information about you.

### Independentness

If you are using a central social network, you are connected to a server and if that server goes down, the entire social network will crash. Even the largest social networks have a chance of their servers crashing. As an example, we can show the collapse of Facebook in 2021. As a result of this event, billions of people could not access Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. But this is not the case in a distributed network. In case of a server crash, you can continue by switching to another server.
